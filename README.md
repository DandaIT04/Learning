# C++ Simple DFS TO DO
- Actually draw the storeCombinations graph with the line connections
- storeCombinations[0].push_back(1); <--- Where 0=1 and 1=2 ---> 1 is connected to 2 and two is connected to 1
- the above code is basically drawing a line between 1 and 2, so there is no need to repeat the process for 2 and 1
- Imagine as if the storeCombinations codes are drawing lines between nodes
